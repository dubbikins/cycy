#CYCY

CYCY (see see) is an application that ships data into and out of a host machine to persitent storage. It is primarily useful for container based applications with ephemral storage that needs to be persisted to long term object base storage systems like amazon S3.
CYCY in the shipping container world stands for container yard to container yard, or the process of moving containers from one yard to another. In a very similar way, CYCY (the app) is meant to ship the data created by containers to persistent object based storage.
